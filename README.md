Common purpose optimization algorithms.

## Algorithms for unconstrained optimization
 - Steepest descent (Wolfe condition);
 - Newton direction (possibly with Hessian modification);
 - Trust region;
 - Congjugate gradeint (Fletcher-Reeves);
 - Quasi-Newton method - BFGS;
 - Quasi-Newton method - SR1 with trust region;
 - Newton method with conjugat gradient.
